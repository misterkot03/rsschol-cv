###A little about myself

I got acquainted with programming in high school. I really liked this direction, but at that time I still didn't understand what I wanted from life, and unfortunately, I gave up doing it. 

But time passed and I decided to resume studying in this direction. I am a very sociable person for whom it will not be difficult to work in a team

In the near future, I see myself as a frontend developer who does not stop developing his skills and improves his knowledge every day
